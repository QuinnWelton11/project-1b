                <h2>Where to use it?</h2>
                <p>You can use CSS custom properties where ever you need. They are very useful and helpful to building
                    websites, and maintaining consistency throughout.
                    CSS variables can be used throughout the entire site or locally to a specific section of the
                    website. To use a variable with the entire site declare it in the :root selector as shown in the
                    coding below.
                </p>
                <table class="wheretable">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Variable Root Selector</th>
                        <th>Variable Useage</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="images/rootvar.jpg" alt="root variables">
                        </td>


                        <td><img src="images/Variables.jpg" alt="variables-in-use">
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </section>
